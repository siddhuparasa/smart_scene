AI powered Video summarization and object detection
Smart Scene is an AI-powered video analysis system that detects objects in each frame using YOLOv7, scores frames based on object importance, and summarizes videos by selecting only the key, high-quality frames. It integrates real-time object detection, frame scoring, and evaluation metrics to generate meaningful video summaries, highlighting important scenes automatically. The system can also label detected objects with their names, providing a clear visual understanding of the scene contents.
